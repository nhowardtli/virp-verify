export_bundle.py — export a Docket evidence bundle (directory form) from a
VIRP chain database snapshot.

    python3 export_bundle.py --db <snapshot.db> --out <bundle-dir> \
        --sessions <id> [<id> ...] [--seal <seal-2026-08.json>] [--artifacts] \

What this script is
-------------------
An EXPORTER. It copies chain rows out of the database into the bundle format
that `docket-bundle` 0.1 / `virp-verify` read (DESIGN.md §2 in the Docket
repository). It copies hashes, HMACs and (if the D-1 columns exist)
signatures exactly as stored. It renumbers nothing, fills no gaps, lowercases
nothing, recomputes nothing. Every judgement about the chain — hashes, links,
genesis, contiguity, head commitment, signatures, seal anchoring — is
virp-verify's job. If this script "fixed" anything the bundle would be
worthless as evidence.

Structural sanity only: the expected tables and columns exist; every required
cell is present (not NULL) and of the expected type; hash/HMAC/signature
cells are hex. Anything else is exported as-is for the verifier to grade.

Safety
------
* Python 3 standard library only. No third-party imports.
* NO NETWORK, unless --witness is given. That flag is the only thing in this
  script that opens a socket, it talks to the URL the operator named and to
  nothing else, and it makes only GET requests: /v1/sth, /v1/proof and
  /v1/pubkey. It sends the witness nothing about the chain — not a session
  id, not a hash, not a head. It asks for a tree head, and for the audit path
  at a leaf index this script read out of a receipt file on this host. A
  witness that is down, slow or hostile can make rows say present=false with
  a reason; it cannot stop the export, alter a chain row, or fail the run.
* The database is opened READ-ONLY through a `file:...?mode=ro&immutable=1`
  URI. `immutable=1` additionally tells SQLite the file will not change
  underneath it, so it takes no locks and creates no `-journal`/`-wal`/`-shm`
  files beside the database. This is correct for a snapshot — which is the
  only thing this script should be pointed at — and still write-safe if it
  is pointed at a live database by mistake (reads may be torn; nothing is
  ever written).
* No PRAGMA that changes the database. `PRAGMA table_info` (read) is used for
  schema discovery; `PRAGMA query_only=ON` is set on the connection as a
  belt-and-braces guard (a connection setting, not a database change).
* Writes go ONLY under `--out`, which must not already exist.

Format facts this script relies on (from DESIGN.md and the fixture bundle)

manifest.json   docket_bundle_version "docket-bundle/0.1", chain_format "v1",
                producer, created_at, sessions[{session_id, path}], seal?
sessions/*.json {session_id, entries[...], head?}
  entry         the twelve canonical fields as JSON values (integers as
                numbers), chain_entry_hash, chain_hmac?, signature?
  head          session_id, last_sequence, last_entry_hash, head_hmac?,
                signature?
  signature     {signature_scheme: "ed25519-detached-v1", signing_key_id,
                signature_hex}
seal/<file>     the virp-seal/1 document, byte-for-byte.
seal/<file>.minisig  (--seal-sig only) the detached minisign SIGNATURE over
                the seal document, byte-for-byte, named in the manifest as
                "seal_signature". The signature may travel in the bundle —
                it is a claim the verifier grades. The PUBLIC KEY that
                checks it never travels in the bundle: virp-verify takes it
                out of band (--seal-key) or reports UNVERIFIABLE.
redaction       (--redacted only) a manifest BLOCK, not a file: the policy
                name, how many entries were withheld, and one record per
                withheld body (artifact_hash + original byte length). It sits
                outside every canonical byte the chain commits to: no session
                file changes, no hash changes, and virp-verify grades a
                redacted bundle exactly as it grades any hash-only one.
artifacts/<hash>  (--artifacts only) raw artifact-body bytes, one file per
                distinct artifact_hash, named in the manifest as
                {"artifact_hash": "...", "path": "artifacts/..."}. The bytes
                are recovered exactly as the producer hashed them: the
                daemon stores bodies in the `artifacts` table either as
                plain TEXT (hashed as UTF-8) or as "base64:<data>" (hashed
                as the decoded bytes). Decoding that envelope is transport
                unwrapping, not re-encoding — and the verifier recomputes
                SHA-256 over the carried bytes against each entry's
                artifact_hash, so a wrong recovery FAILS rather than
                passing. Entries whose (artifact_id, artifact_hash) pair
                has no body row export hash-only and the summary says so;
                a stored body that does not hash to its column value is
                exported AS STORED for the verifier to fail — fixing it
                here would be judging.
artifacts/<sha256>  (--referenced-artifacts only; it needs --artifacts) the
                REFERENCED artifacts as well — the files a camera record
                cites by digest but which have never travelled in a bundle:
                the segment video (segment_sha256), the validator's own
                output about it (sensor_signature.validator_output_sha256),
                and from /6 the device leaf certificate in DER
                (sensor_signature.device_chain.leaf_sha256).
                Listed in the manifest as referenced_artifacts[{sha256,
                cited_by, path, present}], separately from `artifacts`,
                because those are the record and these are the bytes the
                record is ABOUT.

                THE FILE IS NAMED BY THE CITED DIGEST, NOT BY ITS OWN HASH,
                and that is the whole point. A located file is carried
                VERBATIM whether or not it hashes to what the record cites,
                so a tampered segment lands at the cited name and the
                verifier recomputes it into a FAILED. Naming it by its own
                hash would file altered bytes under a name nobody looks up
                and turn tampering into absence — the one confusion this
                carriage cannot afford. Exports only; virp-verify judges.

                A cited artifact this exporter cannot find is listed with
                present=false and no path, NEVER omitted: "the bundle does
                not carry it" and "the record cites nothing" must not read
                the same, and the verifier grades a missing one ABSENT,
                which is not a pass.
witness/sth.json  (--witness only) the signed tree head the proofs below are
                against, as the witness served it: `sth_served` holds the
                response BYTES verbatim, so a reader sees exactly what
                arrived and the verifier checks the Ed25519 over the fields
                parsed out of those bytes. `witness_key_id` is the id the
                witness CLAIMED for itself at GET /v1/pubkey — recorded as a
                claim, exactly like keys.json, and proving nothing. The
                witness PUBLIC KEY never travels in the bundle; the examiner
                supplies it out of band (virp-verify --witness-key) or the
                result is UNVERIFIABLE.
witness/<session>.proof.json  (--witness only) one session's leaf and its
                RFC 9162 inclusion proof: the leaf (chain_id, sequence,
                head_hash, key_id, the submitter's signature over it, and the
                witness's timestamp), leaf_index, tree_size, and the audit
                path. The verifier recomputes the path to the root of the
                SIGNED head above — never to the unsigned root the proof
                endpoint also returns, which is carried only as context.

                HOW leaf_index IS RESOLVED, since this is the one thing the
                witness API cannot answer: it is read from the receipt the
                node-side submitter wrote when it submitted the head
                (virp-witness/deploy/node/virp-witness-submit, which writes
                <head>.witness.json beside each head under
                /var/lib/virp/witness/heads; --witness-receipts points
                elsewhere). Receipts are matched BY LEAF IDENTITY — all four
                of chain_id, sequence, head_hash and key_id must equal the
                ones this export computes from the session's own head — and
                never by file name, which is a hint and not evidence. The
                matched receipt's leaf_index is then confirmed by rebuilding
                the leaf and checking that it hashes to the leaf_hash the
                receipt carries, so the witness timestamp this bundle states
                is the one actually bound into the tree rather than one
                assumed from a neighbouring field.

                The witness API has no route from a leaf's identity to its
                index (GET /v1/proof takes leaf_index and tree_size only),
                which is why the receipt is required and why --witness alone
                is not enough on a host that never submitted.
keys.json       produced ONLY with --keys, from PUBLIC key files the operator
                supplies in either form virp-verify --pin also reads: 64 hex
                characters (the raw public key), or a docket keys.json
                object. The key_id is derived from the bytes either way.
                supplies (the chain schema has no table of public keys; the
                D-1 public half lives as a file on the daemon host, so there
                is nothing in a database to export). Without --keys nothing
                changes: no keys.json, no manifest pointer, and the bundle
                verifies as OPERATOR-ATTESTED — the expected outcome for
                every pre-D-1 (Era 2) session. With --keys, entries are
                written deterministically (sorted by key_id, normalized
                encoding) so the same inputs give byte-identical output;
                key_id is DERIVED from the key bytes (sha256-raw-16), never
                copied from a filename or label, and a stated id that does
                not re-derive is an error. A key file containing secret or
                seed material is refused: no private key material enters
                Docket, ever.

Reproducibility: SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH (unix seconds, the reproducible-builds
convention) pins the manifest's created_at so two exports of the same inputs
are byte-identical. Unset, created_at is the wall clock, as before.
canonical_utf8  NOT produced. The database does not store canonical bytes;
                the verifier rebuilds them from the twelve fields. Emitting a
                rebuilt copy would be computing, not exporting.
